# Write a program that asks the user to enter a string. The program should create a new String called new_string from the userâ€™s string such that the second character is changed to an asterisk and three exclamation points are attached to the end of the string. Finally, print new_string.

def main():
    string = input("Enter a string: ")
    new_string = string[0] + "*" + string[2:] + "!!!"
    print(new_string)
main()
