# Write a class called Product. The class should have fields called name, amount, and price,holding the productâ€™s name, the number of items of that product in stock, and the regular price of the product. There should be a method get_price that receives the number of items to be bought and returns a the cost of buying that many items, where the regular price is charged for orders of less than 10 items, a 10% discount is applied for orders of between 10 and 99 items, and a 20% discount is applied for orders of 100 or more items. There should also be a method called make_purchase that receives the number of items to be bought and decreases amount by that much.

class Product:
    def __init__(self,name,amount,price):
        self.name = name
        self.amount = amount
        self.price = price
    def get_price(self,items):
        if items < 10:
            return self.price * items
        elif items >= 10 and items < 100:
            return self.price * items * 0.9
        else:
            return self.price * items * 0.8
    def make_purchase(self,items):
        if items <= self.amount:
            self.amount -= items
            print(f"Purchase successful. {items} {self.name}(s) remaining: {self.amount}")
        else:
            print(f"Not enough {self.name} in stock. Available amount: {self.amount}")
    def __str__(self):
        return "Product Name: " + self.name + "\nIn stock: " + str(self.amount) + "\nPrice for each: " + str(self.price)
def main():
    p = Product("Pen",100,10)
    print(p)
    items = int(input("Number of items you want to buy: "))
    print(f"The price for {items} items is: ",p.get_price(items))
    p.make_purchase(items)
    print(p)
